Data cleaning & processing: missing values & names of beers
Descriptive statistics
Prediction Models : Logistic Regression, Area Under the Curve, Confusion Matrix and Classification Tree
Test variables, predictors with penalty

# The GOAL is to predict the probability of a beer being successful from various breweries. 
Definition of ‘successful beer’ is when a beer gets an overall review of 4.0 stars and higher.

# Relevant predictors the model:
- Brewery name: categorical variable.
- State: categorical variable.
- City: categorical variable
- ABV (alcohol content): numerical variable
- IBU (bitterness): numerical variable
- Style: categorical variable
- Size of beer in ounces: numerical variable

# In conclusion:
All predictors are exante. 
This project is business oriented and would be useful in determining if a new
craft beer will be successful or not.
Being able to determine the rating will allow the brewery to decide 
whether to launch the new craft beer or not. The advantage is to maximize profit.
A brewery will only launch a new craft beer if it is considered successful.
